# DayThree
creating the empty typle tuple1=()
typle with one element tuple1=(2),two elelment tuple2=(2,3)
tuple3=(1,2,3,4,5,67)
count means that counting the value in tuple and list
count=tuple3.count(5)
output is one beacuse
tuple3= 6 element
Everything in python is treated as object . object.function()
find index of 5,loc=tup3.index(5)
will overwrite the element in list but not in tuples
accessing all elements in tuples
tuple4=tuple2+tuple3
iterator is tup4 here 

for t1 in tup4:

    if t1==5:

        print "element found",t1

len function used for show the length of the value
In dictionary  key and value is there dict={key:values}
